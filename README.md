# Operating-System
This directory includes all the assignment I have completed so far for Operating System(currently working on the last one).  
(1) The first one is mainly about building a simple shell supporing different commands.  
(2) The second one is about using pthread to do matrix multiplication (4096X4096) and write to a proc file.  
(3) The last one is about using scheduling algorithms including Round Robin, First Come First Serve, and Priotiry-Based Preemptive scheduling to arrange tasks.
