# Operating-System
This directory includes all the assignment I have completed so far for Operating System.  
The introduction here is very brief. Please refer to the pdf file and the code in each directory. I have implemented so much more than this.  
(1) The first one is mainly about building a simple shell supporing different commands including multi-pipeline command, background command, etc.  
(2) The second one is about using pthread to do matrix multiplication (4096X4096) and write to a proc file.  
(3) The last one is about writing scheduling algorithms including Round Robin, First Come First Serve, and Priotiry-Based Preemptive scheduling to simulate a scheduler. We use ucontext to create tasks so that we can arrange all of them at the user space.
